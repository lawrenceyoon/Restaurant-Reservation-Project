### Production Links:

#### Back-End

https://restaurant-fullstack-backend.herokuapp.com/tables

### Development:

### Front-End && Back-End

on main dir, run npm run start:dev. This will both start up the front-end and back-end via concurrently. Front-end is accessible through localhost:3000 and back-end is accessible through localhost:5000.

## Context

This project is a monorepo (both client and backend folders under same directory) that was built on my own to demonstrate my knowledge of a full-stack application. Properly routed to the API backend, it does all CRUDL (create, read, update, delete, list) following best RESTful API practices. This project (had a blast creating this), taught me key concepts on how the front-end connects to the back-end, how API calls are made as a request to the backend, and received as a response in the client.

I made 8 user stories, based on what a real world project would be like. Here are my listed steps:
